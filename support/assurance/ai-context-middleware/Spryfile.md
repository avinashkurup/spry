## AI Context Middleware

This script automates the conversion of the latest Secure Controls Framework
(SCF) Excel workbook from the
[official SCF GitHub repository](https://github.com/securecontrolsframework/securecontrolsframework)
into a structured SQLite database.

- Uses DuckDB with its built-in `excel` and `sqlite` extensions.
- Reads each major worksheet from the SCF Excel workbook (e.g., _SCF 2025.3_,
  _Authoritative Sources_, _Assessment Objectives_, etc.).
- Creates corresponding SQLite tables with matching names (e.g., `scf_control`,
  `scf_authoritative_source`, etc.).
- All columns are imported as untyped strings (`VARCHAR`), preserving the
  original Excel text exactly as-is.
- Adds a metadata column `scf_xls_source` to every table to record the source
  workbook name for provenance.
- Creates a registry view `scf_xls_sheet` listing each imported sheet, its
  corresponding table, and the source file name.

Instructions:

1. Download the SCF Excel workbook from the GitHub repo.
2. Run the DuckDB SQL script.

   ```bash
   rm -f scf-2025.3.sqlite.db && cat prepare.duckdb.sql | duckdb ":memory:"
   ```

## Layout

This cell instructs Spry to automatically inject the SQL `PARTIAL` into all
SQLPage content cells. The name `global-layout.sql` is not signficant (it's
required by Spry but just used for reference) but the `--inject **/*` argument
is how matching occurs. The `--BEGIN` and `--END` comments are not required by
Spry but makes it easier to trace where _partial_ injections are occuring.

```sql PARTIAL global-layout.sql --inject **/*
-- BEGIN: PARTIAL global-layout.sql
SELECT 'shell' AS component,
       'AI Context Middleware' AS title,
       NULL AS icon,
       'https://www.surveilr.com/assets/brand/content-assembler.ico' AS favicon,
       'https://www.surveilr.com/assets/brand/compliance-explorer.png' AS image,

       true AS fixed_top_menu,
       'index.sql' AS link,
       '{"link":"/index.sql","title":"Home"}' AS menu_item;

SET resource_json = sqlpage.read_file_as_text('spry.d/auto/resource/${path}.auto.json');
SET page_title  = json_extract($resource_json, '$.route.caption');
-- END: PARTIAL global-layout.sql
-- this is the `${cell.info}` cell on line ${cell.startLine}
```

## AI Context Middleware Home Page

Index page which automatically generates links to all `/ai-context` pages.
`navigation_node` is automatically generated by Spry.

```sql index.sql { route: { caption: "Home" } }
SET routes_json = sqlpage.read_file_as_text('spry.d/auto/route/forest.auto.json');
SET root_path   = '/ai-context';

SELECT 'card' AS component, '' AS title, 2 AS columns;
SELECT
  IFNULL(json_extract(c.value,'$.payloads[0].caption'),
         json_extract(c.value,'$.basename'))                         AS title,
  json_extract(c.value,'$.payloads[0].description')                  AS description_md,
  json_extract(c.value,'$.path')                                     AS link
FROM json_each(
       json_extract(
         (SELECT jt.value
          FROM json_tree(json($routes_json)) AS jt
          WHERE jt.type='object'
            AND json_extract(jt.value,'$.path') = $root_path
          LIMIT 1),
         '$.children'
