## Secure Controls Framework (SCF) Exploration

This script automates the conversion of the latest Secure Controls Framework
(SCF) Excel workbook from the
[official SCF GitHub repository](https://github.com/securecontrolsframework/securecontrolsframework)
into a structured SQLite database.

- Uses DuckDB with its built-in `excel` and `sqlite` extensions.
- Reads each major worksheet from the SCF Excel workbook (e.g., _SCF 2025.3_,
  _Authoritative Sources_, _Assessment Objectives_, etc.).
- Creates corresponding SQLite tables with matching names (e.g., `scf_control`,
  `scf_authoritative_source`, etc.).
- All columns are imported as untyped strings (`VARCHAR`), preserving the
  original Excel text exactly as-is.
- Adds a metadata column `scf_xls_source` to every table to record the source
  workbook name for provenance.
- Creates a registry view `scf_xls_sheet` listing each imported sheet, its
  corresponding table, and the source file name.

Instructions:

1. Download the SCF Excel workbook from the GitHub repo.
2. Run the DuckDB SQL script.

   ```bash
   rm -f scf-2025.3.sqlite.db && cat prepare.duckdb.sql | duckdb ":memory:"
   ```
3. Build the SQLPage notebook page from `README.md` and pipe it into the database:
  
   ```bash
   ../../../lib/sqlpage/spry.ts --md README.md --package --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json | sqlite3 scf-2025.3.sqlite.db
   ```

4. Start the SQLPage server:

   - Linux (from repository root): `SQLPAGE_SITE_PREFIX="" sqlpage.bin`
